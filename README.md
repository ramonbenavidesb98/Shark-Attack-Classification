# Shark Attack Prediction Project

This project analyzes shark attack data to detect patterns and predict whether a scan is suspicious using environmental features (CO₂, VOC, humidity, temperature, etc.).

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Logistic Regression
- Negative Binomial Modeling
- Hybrid Blending Methods

## My Contribution
This was a group project as part of my Master’s program at Georgia Tech. My main contributions included:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Developing logistic regression model for predicting suspicious activity
- Visualizations and interpretation of model performance

## How to Use
Open and run the `Notebook_2_Modeling_Environmental_Features.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
