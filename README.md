# Shark Attack Fatality Classification and Clustering Project

This project investigates patterns in global shark attack incidents to predict whether an attack is fatal using structured data from the Global Shark Attack File. It combines classification modeling, clustering, and statistical testing to identify key risk factors and trends in fatal attacks.

## Objective
To predict the likelihood of a fatal outcome in a shark attack and uncover data-driven insights about risk factors using machine learning, clustering, and statistical methods.

## Technologies & Techniques
- **Python**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **ML Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE, undersampling, hybrid techniques
- **Clustering**: KMeans
- **Statistical Testing**: ANOVA, Chi-Square
- **Feature Engineering**: Season, activity type, time of day, weekend/weekday

## My Contributions
This was a collaborative project as part of my Master of Science in Analytics program at Georgia Tech. My contributions included:
- Leading exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering
- Developing and evaluating classification models for predicting fatal attacks
- Performing clustering analysis to identify risk profiles
- Conducting hypothesis testing to validate statistical significance
- Creating visualizations and interpreting results for our final report

## Key Results
- Achieved >80% accuracy using XGBoost and Random Forest models
- Identified key predictors such as shark species, victim activity, and country
- Revealed 3 meaningful clusters based on age, time, and fatality patterns
- Validated findings through statistical testing (ANOVA and Chi-Square)

## Context
This project was completed for the ISyE 7406: Data Mining & Statistical Learning course at Georgia Tech. It demonstrates the application of predictive modeling and clustering in real-world classification problems involving rare events.
